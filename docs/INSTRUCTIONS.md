# BIR Instruction Set

This is the complete instruction listing for the BarraCUDA Intermediate Representation. Each entry specifies the mnemonic, syntax, operand layout, subop encoding, result type, and operational semantics.

Conventions used throughout this document:

- `%N` refers to an SSA value (instruction result, referenced by index).
- Bare integers (`0`, `42`, `-1`) and floats (`3.14`) are inline constants.
- `null`, `undef`, `zeroinit` are special constant forms.
- `T` stands for any BIR type (`i32`, `f32`, `ptr<global, f32>`, etc.).
- Block labels appear as `bb0`, `bb1`, or by name (`entry`, `if.then`).
- `subop` is a per-instruction modifier field packed into the instruction word. Its meaning depends on the opcode.

```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| Operands | `ops[0]` = address (pointer) |
| Result | `T` (the loaded value type) |
| subop | 0 = normal, 1 = volatile |

| subop | 0 = normal, 1 = volatile |

Writes `%val` to the given address. This instruction produces no result value.

Volatile stores are never reordered or eliminated.

---

%r = gep PTR_TYPE, %base, %idx0 [, %idx1, ...]
```

| Field | Value |

| subop | unused |

Adds byte offsets to the base pointer computed from each index multiplied by the corresponding element size. The result pointer inherits the address space of the base.

---

## Control Flow

Terminator instructions. Every basic block must end with exactly one of these.

### `br`

```
br TARGET
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = target block index |

|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = condition (`i1`), `ops[1]` = true block, `ops[2]` = false block |
| Result | `void` |
| subop | unused |

If `%cond` is nonzero, transfers control to `TRUE_BLOCK`. Otherwise transfers to `FALSE_BLOCK`.

On GPU backends, divergent conditional branches (where threads within a wavefront disagree on the condition) are handled via execution mask manipulation.

---

### `switch`

Multi-way branch.

```
switch %val, default DEFAULT_BLOCK [, [CONST: BLOCK], ...]
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = selector value, `ops[1]` = default block. Case pairs in overflow. |
| Result | `void` |
| subop | unused |

Compares `%val` against each case constant. If a match is found, branches to the corresponding block. If no match, branches to the default block.

Uses the overflow mechanism when there are case entries. In overflow mode: `extra[0]` = selector, `extra[1]` = default block, then alternating `(constant, block)` pairs.

---

### `ret`

Return from function.

```
ret T %val
ret void
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = return value (omitted for void) |

---

### `unreachable`

```
unreachable
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | none |
| Result | `void` |
| subop | unused |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | alternating `(block_index, value_ref)` pairs |
| Result | `T` |
| subop | unused |

Selects a value based on which predecessor block control flow came from. Each `(block, value)` pair specifies: "if we arrived from this block, use this value."

Phi nodes must appear at the beginning of a block, before any non-phi, non-param instructions. They are inserted by the `mem2reg` pass.

With 3 or fewer predecessors, the pairs fit in the 6 inline operand slots. With more predecessors, the overflow mechanism is used.

---

### `param`

Function parameter.

```
%r = param T
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | none |
| Result | `T` (the parameter type) |
| subop | parameter index (0, 1, 2, ...) |

Declares a function parameter. These appear at the start of the entry block, in order. For kernel functions (`__global__`), parameters are loaded from the kernel argument segment. For device functions (`__device__`), parameters arrive in registers.

---

## Thread Model

```
%r = thread_id.x
%r = thread_id.y

| Result | `i32` |
| subop | dimension (0=x, 1=y, 2=z) |

%r = block_id.y
%r = block_id.z
```

| Result | `i32` |
| subop | dimension (0=x, 1=y, 2=z) |

```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | none |
| Result | `void` |

```
barrier_group
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | none |
| Result | `void` |

## Atomics

Atomic memory operations. All read-modify-write instructions take a pointer and a value, perform the operation atomically, and return the **old** value at the memory location. The `subop` field encodes the memory ordering.

**Memory orderings (subop values):**

| subop | Mnemonic | Meaning |

| Operands | `ops[0]` = pointer |
| Result | `T` (loaded value) |
| subop | memory ordering |

Atomically reads the value at `%ptr` with the specified ordering guarantee.

---

### `atomic_store`

Atomic store.

```
atomic_store ORDER T %val, %ptr
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = value, `ops[1]` = pointer |
| Result | `void` |
| subop | memory ordering |

Atomically writes `%val` to `%ptr` with the specified ordering guarantee.

## Warp-Level Primitives

Cross-lane communication within a wavefront. These are target-independent; backends lower them to the appropriate hardware mechanism.

### `shfl`

Warp shuffle. Read a value from an arbitrary lane.

```
%r = shfl T %val, %lane [, %mask]
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = source value, `ops[1]` = source lane, `ops[2]` = width mask (if present) |
| Result | `T` |
| subop | unused |

CUDA equivalent: `__shfl_sync`.

---

### `shfl_up`

Shuffle up. Read from a lower-numbered lane.

```
%r = shfl_up T %val, %delta [, %mask]
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = source value, `ops[1]` = delta, `ops[2]` = width mask (if present) |
| Result | `T` |
| subop | unused |

Reads the value from lane `(current_lane - delta)`. If the source lane is out of range, the thread's own value is returned.

CUDA equivalent: `__shfl_up_sync`.

---

### `shfl_down`

Shuffle down. Read from a higher-numbered lane.

```
%r = shfl_down T %val, %delta [, %mask]
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = source value, `ops[1]` = delta, `ops[2]` = width mask (if present) |
| Result | `T` |
| subop | unused |

Reads the value from lane `(current_lane + delta)`. If the source lane is out of range, the thread's own value is returned.

CUDA equivalent: `__shfl_down_sync`.

---

### `shfl_xor`

Shuffle XOR. Read from a lane computed by XOR.

```
%r = shfl_xor T %val, %mask_val [, %width]
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = source value, `ops[1]` = XOR mask, `ops[2]` = width (if present) |
| Result | `T` |
| subop | unused |

Reads the value from lane `(current_lane ^ mask_val)`. Commonly used for butterfly reduction patterns.

CUDA equivalent: `__shfl_xor_sync`.

---

### `ballot`

Warp ballot. Returns a bitmask of active lanes where the predicate is true.

```
%r = ballot T %pred
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = predicate value |
| Result | `i32` (bitmask) |
| subop | unused |

Each bit in the result corresponds to one lane. Bit `N` is set if lane `N`'s predicate is nonzero.

CUDA equivalent: `__ballot_sync`.

---

### `vote_any`

True if any lane's predicate is true.

```
%r = vote_any T %pred
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = predicate value |
| Result | `i32` (boolean: 0 or 1) |
| subop | unused |

Returns nonzero if at least one active lane has a nonzero predicate.

CUDA equivalent: `__any_sync`.

---

### `vote_all`

True if all lanes' predicates are true.

```
%r = vote_all T %pred
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = predicate value |
| Result | `i32` (boolean: 0 or 1) |
| subop | unused |

Returns nonzero only if every active lane has a nonzero predicate.

CUDA equivalent: `__all_sync`.

---

## Miscellaneous

### `call`

Function call.

```
%r = call T @function_name(%arg0, %arg1, ...)
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = callee function index (into `funcs[]`), `ops[1..N]` = arguments |
| Result | `T` (function return type) |
| subop | unused |

Calls the named function with the given arguments. The return type is determined by the callee's function type.

With 5 or fewer arguments, the callee index and arguments fit in the 6 inline operand slots. With more arguments, the overflow mechanism is used: `extra[0]` = callee index, `extra[1..]` = arguments.

---

### `select`

Conditional value selection.

```
%r = select T %cond, %true_val, %false_val
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | `ops[0]` = condition (`i1`), `ops[1]` = value if true, `ops[2]` = value if false |
| Result | `T` (same as the true/false value types) |
| subop | unused |

If `%cond` is nonzero, produces `%true_val`. Otherwise produces `%false_val`. This is the SSA-friendly equivalent of the C ternary operator and does not introduce control flow.

---

### `inline_asm`

Inline assembly block.

```
inline_asm "..."
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operands | implementation-defined |
| Result | implementation-defined |
| subop | unused |

Placeholder for inline assembly. Allows direct emission of target-specific instructions. Not yet fully implemented.

---

## Reserved

Opcodes 128-143 (`BIR_TEX_BASE` through `BIR_TEX_MAX`) are reserved for future texture and surface operations. These are not yet implemented.
